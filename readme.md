This ECL parser has been generated using [ANTL4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4)

The grammar file we're using comes originally from the [repo](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomed-ecl-parser/tree/master/src/main/antlr4/org/snomed/langauges/ecl/generated/parser) but it could get deleted so it's better to keep a copy of it in our repo.
